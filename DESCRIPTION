Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    c(person(given = "Youzhi",
             family = "Yu",

Description: R provides fantastic tools for changepoint
    analysis, but plots generated by the tools do 
    not have the 'ggplot2' style. This tool, however, 
    combines 'changepoint', 'changepoint.np' and 'ecp'
    together, and uses 'ggplot2' to visualize changepoints.
